# Camila AI Journal

Welcome to my learning journal! 👩🏻‍💻✨

This repository is dedicated to documenting my hands-on journey with Python, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning — from foundational concepts to real-world applications.

I'm currently enrolled in the [BairesDev Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.dio.me), where I'm exploring how to apply AI to strategic communication, ethical innovation, and human-centered leadership.
