# Camila AI Journal

Welcome to my learning journal! 👩🏻‍💻✨

This repository is dedicated to documenting my hands-on journey with Python, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning — from foundational concepts to real-world applications.

I'm currently enrolled in the [BairesDev Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.dio.me), where I'm exploring how to apply AI to strategic communication, ethical innovation, and human-centered leadership.

## 🎯 Purpose
To create a transparent and reflective space where I can track my progress, share projects, and translate complex topics into practical insights.

## 🧠 Topics I'll be exploring
- Python fundamentals and applied logic
- Machine Learning basics
- LLMs and prompt engineering
- AI in strategic communication
- Human-aligned design in tech

---

## 📚 Weekly Logs
Each week, I’ll add reflections and key learnings from the bootcamp in individual markdown files inside the `/bootcamp-bairesdev-2025` folder.

Stay tuned!

Let’s build with purpose.  
💛 Camila Fernandes
